# Chess-Game-Design-with-GUI-for-2-agents
Design a chess-inspired game with a graphical user interface (GUI) where a human user, controlling a King and a Boat, competes against the system, which controls a King. The game implements point-based movement costs and follows specific movement rules for each piece, and uses search algorithms for the systemâ€™s decision-making.
